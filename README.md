# JAS

I am trying to build a Static Analysis for JS in JS.

Right now, everything is in beta (early early beta).

However, if you want to try, just launch testRewrite.js (and write the code you want to analyze in simpleCode.js).

Don't hesitate to contact me for any comment, or even if you want to join this project !
